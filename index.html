      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted small">for <strong>Westie Notes</strong> • Effective date: <time datetime="2025-10-02">October 2, 2025</time></p>
    </header>

    <section class="card">
      <p><strong>Westie Notes</strong> is a note‑taking app designed to help you organize your thoughts, tasks, and ideas. We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles information. In short: <em>your notes are encrypted before being stored</em>, and we use <em>Firebase Authentication</em> and <em>Firebase Storage</em> to provide secure backup and sync features.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to the Westie Notes mobile application available on iOS and Android. By using the app, you agree to the practices described here.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Authentication.</strong> We use Firebase Authentication to let you sign in securely. This may involve storing your email address or other identifiers needed for login.</li>
      <li><strong>Encrypted Notes Storage.</strong> Your notes are encrypted locally before being uploaded to Firebase Storage. This means Firebase never sees your raw, unencrypted data.</li>
      <li><strong>No third‑party tracking.</strong> We do not use advertising SDKs or analytics tools that track you across apps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Local and Cloud Storage</h2>
    <p>Your notes are encrypted and then stored in Firebase Storage so they can be backed up and accessed across devices. A copy of your notes may also be kept locally on your device for offline access. If you uninstall the app, your local data will be deleted, but your encrypted cloud backup will remain linked to your account until you delete it.</p>

    <h2>4. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>Westie Notes requests only the minimal permissions required for its core features (for example, notifications to remind you of tasks). Granting or revoking permissions can be managed in your device settings. Westie Notes does not access your contacts, photos, location, microphone, or camera unless a specific feature clearly requires it and you choose to enable it.</p>

    <h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>Westie Notes integrates with Firebase (by Google) for authentication and secure cloud storage. These services are subject to Google’s Privacy Policy in addition to this policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Westie Notes is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can address it.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may request deletion of your account and associated cloud data at any time. Because Westie Notes encrypts your notes before uploading, we cannot read or process your content. Under GDPR/CCPA, you may have rights to access, deletion, or portability of your account‑related data (such as your email for authentication). To exercise these rights, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>Westie Notes encrypts your notes before storing them. Please also protect your device with a passcode and keep your operating system up to date. If you export data or use external backup tools, the security of that exported data depends on those services.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy to reflect improvements or changes in the app. If a material change occurs, we will update the effective date above and may provide an in‑app notice.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:unyawndeveloper@gmail.com">unyawndeveloper@gmail.com</a>.</p>
