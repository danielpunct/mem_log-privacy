      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted small">for <strong>Planner</strong> • Effective date: <time datetime="2025-09-10">September 10, 2025</time></p>

    <section class="card">
      <p><strong>Planner</strong> is a free app designed to group details of events you are attending, all the bookings information and transportation details. We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles information. In short: <em>Planner does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data</em>. All your content stays <em>on your device</em>.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to the Planner mobile application available on iOS and Android. By using the app, you agree to the practices described here.</p>

    <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No personal information is collected.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>No analytics or tracking.</strong> Planner does not use analytics SDKs or cookies.</li>
      <li><strong>No account required.</strong> You can use Planner without signing in.</li>
      <li><strong>No network transmission of your content.</strong> Your tasks, notes, and settings remain on your device unless you explicitly export or back them up using your own system tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Local-Only Storage</h2>
    <p>All app data (e.g., tasks, notes, preferences) is stored locally on your device. If you uninstall the app, your locally stored data will be deleted from your device. Please make backups if needed before uninstalling.</p>

    <h2>4. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>Planner requests only the minimal permissions required for its core features (for example, notifications to remind you of tasks). Granting or revoking permissions can be managed in your device settings. Planner does not access your contacts, photos, location, microphone, or camera unless a specific feature clearly requires it and you choose to enable it.</p>

    <h2>5. No Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>Planner does not integrate third‑party advertising, analytics, or social media SDKs. No data is shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Planner is suitable for general audiences and does not collect personal data. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information to any app store listing or support channel outside the app, please contact us so we can address it.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Because Planner does not collect or store personal data on external servers, rights related to access, correction, deletion, portability, or objection (e.g., under GDPR/CCPA) typically do not apply in the context of server‑side processing. However, you fully control your data on your device and may delete it at any time by clearing app data or uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We design Planner to keep your information on-device. Please protect your device with a passcode and keep your operating system up to date. If you choose to export data or use system‑level backups, the security of that data is governed by those services.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy to reflect improvements or changes in the app. If a material change occurs, we will update the effective date above and may provide an in‑app notice.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:unyawndeveloper@gmail.com">unyawndeveloper@gmail.com</a>.</p>
